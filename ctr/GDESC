Cut the Rope to feed large pieces of candy to a hungry creature called Om Nom. Collect all the stars for the highest rating and progress to more challenging levels with new puzzles.

How to play: 
Cut the ropes in the correct order so the candy swings and collects all the stars, then feed Om Nom. Sometimes, you have to slice through the rope at the right moment, so it falls in the right direction.
You need a certain number of stars to continue progress in Cut the Rope. As you get further, youâ€™ll encounter new puzzle elements like bubbles and air cushions. Use these devices to secure all the stars before feeding little Om Nom.
