Getaway Shooter is a chaotic two-player game where you race three others to the extraction point.
You can only move by jumping left or right, which makes the race a little tricky! Pick up guns and other weapons along the way to use against the others!

How to play
Play solo or with a friend
Team up with a friend using the same keyboard, or play one-player mode. 
Choose one of the characters and jump into the game!

Jump to move
Once you’ve started a race, you may notice you can only move by jumping left or right, creating quite a chaotic scene! The degree you move at depends on how long you hold in either direction.

Anything goes
There are multiple rounds in the race, each taking place in a different location. Race to the finish line and pick up weapons and upgrades as you come across them. Use your weapons to attack the other racers on your way to the end!
