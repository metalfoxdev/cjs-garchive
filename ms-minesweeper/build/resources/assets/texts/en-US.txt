helpHTP_1=Goal: Uncover the empty squares, while avoiding the mines, in the quickest time possible. You win if you uncover all the safe squares and you lose if you trigger a mine.
helpHTP_2=Numbers: Each number tells you how many mines touch that square. Use this information to deduce which adjacent squares are safe to uncover.
helpHTP_3=Counter Bar: The mine counter tells you how many mines are still hidden, and the timer keeps track of how many seconds it takes you to clear the board.
helpControlsMouse_1=Uncovering squares: Click on a square to uncover it. The first click is always safe.
helpControlsMouse_2=Flags: Right-click a square you suspect contains a mine. This puts a flag on the square.
helpControlsMouse_3=Question marks: If you are uncertain about a square, right-click it twice to mark it with a question mark.
helpControlsMouse_4=Chord: If all of the mines touching a number are flagged, you can double-click that number, press both mouse buttons, or press the mouse wheel on it to uncover the remaining adjacent squares.
helpControlsMouse_5=Panning: Click and drag the mouse to scroll across the board in any direction.
helpControlsMouse_6=Zooming: Use mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out.
helpControlsTouch_1=Uncovering squares: Tap a square to uncover it. The first tap is always safe.
helpControlsTouch_2=Flags: To mark a square you suspect contains a mine, press and hold on that square until a flag appears.
helpControlsTouch_3=Question Marks: Press and hold on a flagged square to change the flag to a question mark. Use a question mark if youâ€™re not certain about a square.
helpControlsTouch_4=Flag Mode: To switch the controls for placing a flag, tap the Flag Mode button in the top right corner of the screen.
helpControlsTouch_5=Tap to Flag Mode: In this mode, tap a square to place a flag and press and hold a square to uncover it.
helpControlsTouch_6=Swipe Flagging: If the Swipe Flagging option is ON, you can flag a square by touching its center and swiping up or down. Repeat this gesture to place a question mark.
helpControlsTouch_7=Chord: If all the mines touching a number are flagged, you can tap that number to uncover the remaining adjacent squares.
helpControlsTouch_8=Panning: Touch and drag with your finger to scroll across the board in any direction.
helpControlsTouch_9=Zooming: Pinch two fingers together to zoom out and pull them apart to zoom in.
helpTips_1=Explore the Unexplored: Not sure where to click next? Try uncovering some unexplored territory. You're better off clicking in the middle of unmarked squares than in an area you suspect is mined.
helpTips_2=Mark the Obvious: If a number 1 touches only one square, it must be a mine. If a 2 touches only two squares, they must both be mines. And so on.
helpTips_3=Pattern 1-2-1: You can mark two mines with certainty if you see a 1-2-1 pattern in a straight line (they're in the squares beside the 1s).
helpTips_4=Pattern 1-2-2-1: You can mark two mines with certainty if you see 1-2-2-1 pattern in a straight line (they're in the squares beside the 2s).
