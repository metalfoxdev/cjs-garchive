DONT FORGET TO EXPORT SAVE OR IT WONT SAVE!

Cookie Clicker is a Javascript game released by Orteil on August 8, 2013.
It is an "incrementer" game, as proclaimed by Orteil.
The point of the game is to bake cookies by clicking on a giant cookie until you have enough cookies to buy upgrades. 
The seemingly endless gameplay makes it a game that can last an indefinite amount of time, 
or at least until your device can no longer run it.
