Tanuki Sunset Classic is a third-person longboard-skating game where players play as a raccoon skating downhill on a procedurally generated synthwave-themed seaside road.

Drift your way around the narrow corners, gather Tanuki Bits to fill up your Bonus Roulette Meter and try and gather as many points as you can.

Drift often. Get some air-time and avoid cars and obstacles while pushing your luck close to the walls and edges to get near-miss moments and tight-squeezes to maximize your score.

This game supports Xbox 360 controller input and Keyboard controls.
